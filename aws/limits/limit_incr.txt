I am requesting these limit increases in support of an ongoing, funded project to build and maintain the recount2 and Snaptron resources.  These resources contain large amounts of summarized RNA sequencing data (similar to DNA sequencing data) from over 70,000 humans.  We use AWS, including EC2 (with EBS ephemeral storage), Elastic MapReduce and the Spot market to process raw data into these summaries.  Our past work in these areas have been funded by numerous AWS in Education research grants, and we are currently funded by multiple NIH grants including a Cloud Commons Pilot grant, which is funding this particular account.  (I have made similar requests for other accounts under my control in the)  We have ample experience running very large ElasticMapreduce jobs spanning hundreds of instances in the past.

Some DOIs of relevant publications:
- recount2: 10.1038/nbt.3838
- Snaptron: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btx547
- Intropolis: 10.1186/s13059-016-1118-6

Provisioned IOPS = 500000
Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volume storage (TiB) = 500
General Purpose (SSD) volume storage (TiB) = 500
