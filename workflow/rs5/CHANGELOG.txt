All updates since 1.0.2 are compatible with the output of 1.0.2.

1.0.6:
    BigWig & seqTK fastq check files are no longer zstd compressed

1.0.5:
    KEEP_BAM, KEEP_FASTQ, KEEP_UNMAPPED_FASTQ, and NO_SHARED_MEM options
    added to workflow.bash (and in the last case the Snakemake).

1.0.4
    temporary directory for download/aligning now split into 2 different
    directories, TEMP and TEMP_BIG to allow for more fine grained control
    over how temporary files are handled.  This was an attempt to alleviate
    the problem of too many small files being created/deleted on Lustre.
